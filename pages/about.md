## About the Collection
This is a collection of recipes which were created or distributed by Joan McCormick, my great-grandmother. The current uploaded photographs are from my mother's personal collection which was given to her by Joan for her wedding. Eventually, this collection will include the recipes held by Cameron McCormick. This collection is intended to be used by my family members for increased access to the recipes and so that we can preserve both the recipes and the memory of Joan McCormick <3.
